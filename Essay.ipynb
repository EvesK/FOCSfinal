    "A context free grammar, or CFG, is a grammar that is used to generate all possible strings in a given language. A context free grammar, G, can be defined by a tuple \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G = (\\Sigma, \\Gamma, R, S)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$\\Sigma$$ is a list of terminal symbols, $$\\Gamma$$ is a list of non-terminal symbols, R is a list of rules of the form $$x -> \\mu$$ where $$\\mu \\elem (\\Gamma \\cup \\Sigma)*$$, and S is the start symbol. One way of defining a language is to write a CFG for that language. Then, we can find for any string whether that string is in the language by evaluating whether the rules of the CFG could possibly generate that string. For this method we start with the start symbol S and apply the rules continuously until we generate the desired string. If we can't generate the string after (a reasonable number of) rules applications *double check this is actually right; are CFGs where you get stuck or where you run out??*, we can conclude that the given string is not valid for the language described by that CFG.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is CFG Parsing? <a name=\"subintroduction1\"></a>\n",
    "CFG parsing is another way to find whether a given string is valid for a language as described by a CFG. Instead of starting with S and building up to the given string using the rules, CFG parsing works backwards, starting with the given string and seeing if we can reduce it to S using a combination of the given rules.\n",
